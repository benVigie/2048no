2048no
======

Personal version of the famous 2048 game, made with Arduino and some led :) 

![alt text](http://vigie-benjamin.com/images/projects/2048no.gif "Live demo")


## The project
The idea was just to make a "real" version of 2048 with an Arduino board.
Instead of numbers, you play here with colors and you can control the game with motion.

I did it just for fun, I'm not an electronic expert. So if you want to fix or improve something, pull requests are welcome :smile:



## Components used in this project
  * 1 [Arduino Uno](http://store.arduino.cc/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=11&products_id=195)
  * 1 8x8 RGB matrix from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1487)
  * 1 accelerometer (mine comes from [Snootlab](http://snootlab.fr/adafruit/380-adxl335-accelerometre-3-axes-5v-3g.html))
  * 1 Piezzo buzzer
  * Legos :heart: !!!
  
If you want to put your project in a box, try to find a box (lol), a power supply for your arduino and something to protect your RGB matrix. I recommend a blurry glass.
